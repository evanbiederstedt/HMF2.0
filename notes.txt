## PCA vs HMF
## PCA describes the subspace of data space in which actual data resides.
## PCA naturally locates the K-dimensional
## linear basis that minimizes the mean-squared error in the space in which all
## pixels of all spectra are treated equally
## Optimizes squared error
##
## HMF optimizes NOT optimizes not squared error, but rather the justified probabilistic
## objective of chi-squared, finds basis set K-dim that optimizes a justified scalar objective
##
## K equals number of components permitted, i.e. dim of model space

##
##  K components g_{jk} and coefficients a_{ik}, over all the N spectra and the M pixels of the training set
##
##  [N,K] coefficients a_{ik}
##  [K,M] parameters g_{kj} in basis spectra
##  data:  [N,M]
##  innvar: either a scalar or else [N,M]
##  \epsilon: scalar that sets strength of smoothing; regularization equals smoothness prior
##  Adjustments: Impose (1) regularization and (2) non-negativity a_{ik} > 0, g_{kj} > 0
##  All the negative fluxes and their corresponding errors in observed spectra are set to zero
##
##  N: number of M dimensional data points
##  M: number of wavelengths
##  K: number of components permitted
##
##  HMF optimizes probabilistic objective function, i.e. minimize chi**2,
##  returns K components whose linear combination best reproduces the entire training set of the observations,
##  given the reported observational uncertainty variances, \sigma^2_ij
##
##  CONTRAST TO PCA RESULTS
##  (1) HMF produces basis functions that fit the real data much better
##  (2) HMF is also able to extract more information from the training set (more data points, more data dimensions)
##
##  For SDSS double redshift objects, there are N observed spectra i, \vec{f}_i such that
##  f_{ij}=f_{\lambda, i}(\lambda_j)=\Sum^K_{k=1} a_{ik} g_{k}(\lambda_j)+n_{ij}
##  that is, we model spectrum of each object i with sum of K linear components
##  Note: use SDSS pixel flux densities f_{ij} interpolated by cubic-spline interpolation
##  onto a common rest-frame wavelength grid, logarithmically spaced in wavelength
##
##  training set =  subset of data at rest-frame wavelengths
##
##  We use the training set to define a set of basis functions that minimize scalar \Chi_{\epsilon}**2
##  Training points f_{ij} with errors \sigma_{ij} by set of K components g_{kj} and coefficients a_{ik}
##  over all N spectra nd M pixels of a training set.
##
##  In order to minimize \Chi_{\epsilon}**2, do step-by-step procedure:
##  a-step: fix g_kj ---> estimate optimal a_ij
##  g-step: fix a_ik ---> estimate optimal g_kj
##
##  Start at an all-positive guess and then iterate!
##  Iteration proceeds to convergence
##
##  PROCEDURE
##  Use HMF to define a small number of components that is sufficient for modeling SDSS spectra.
##  Using these components, fit each observed spectrum at the redshift provided by SDSS.
##  Then repeat the fitting, but this time using one set of components at the SDSS redshift
##  and one set of components at values of redshift that lie on a nominal grid. If a second
##  object is present we expect the fit to be significantly improved when we use two sets of
##  components, one at the redshift of SDSS and one at that of the second object.
##
##  This second redshift is scanning a regular grid of values selected to be uniform in a logarithmic scale,
##  i.e. in the same way as the wavelengths in SDSS. In this way moving to the next value of the redshift grid is
##  equivalent to shifting the spectrum by one pixel.
##
##
##  INITIALIZATION
##  Use the mean spectrum and the top [K − 1] eigenvectors from the PCA in the orthogonal subspace
##  i.e. use PCA to produce a mean spectrum and then the [K − 1] top eigenvectors orthogonal to it
##  i.e. before performing PCA, we project the spectra into a subspace orthogonal to the mean spectrum,
##  by scaling them and subtracting the mean spectrum from each one of them
##
##  PCA results used as an initialization. The training data were first
##  projected into a hyperplane orthogonal to the mean spectrum that is passing from the
##  zero point. i.e.
##  Each spectrum was scaled appropriately and the mean spectrum was
##  subtracted from it. The flux in each spectral bin was divided with the RMS
##  of the error in that pixel for all the non-masked pixels in the training sample.

### BHB candidates in SDSS QSO spectra based on large velocity shifts between NLs and BLs
### NL = narrow line
### BL = broad line
### QSO spectra 0.1 < z < 1.5
###
### Assuming one BH is active, BLs associated to the accreting BH expected to show systematic velocity shifts
### w/r.t. NL, which trace the rest-frame of the galaxy
###
### GOAL: Search for two sets of emission lines NL and BL withsmall separation between them,
### caused by the Keplerian rotation of one component of the binary system
###
### Training set = subset of data at rest-frame wavelengths
###
### STEP 1: training set defines set of basis functions that minimize \chi squared
### STEP 2: use resulting components a, g to fit each observed spectrum at redshift z_SDSS, redshift provided by SDSS
### STEP 3: repeat the fitting using two sets of components at different redshifts, i.e.
###         one set z_SDSS and the other set z_2nd free to vary over broad range of redshifts s.t.
###         z corresponding to velocity differences up to 30 000 km/s
###         If second redshift system present, fit significantly improves when
###         second set of components added

## GOAL: Find double redshifts in SDSS LRG spectroscopy
##
## http://hoggideas.blogspot.com/2012/10/find-lrg-lrg-double-redshifts.html
##
## Why?
## DWH: "Rarely have double redshifts been found without emission lines
## (LRG spectra are almost purely stellar with no nebular lines),
## and because the LRGs sometimes host radio sources,
## you might even get a Hubble-constant-measuring golden lens"
##
## **Hubble-constant-measuring golden lens** It's worth a try!
##
## Recall LRG: http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212087
##             http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/323717/pdf
## LRGs show little rotation, have smooth radial profiles,
## are massive and kinematically hot, have a narrow range of stellarmass-to-light
## ratios, show high metallicities, and reside
## preferentially in the Universe’s denser environments
##
## LRGs are old elliptical galaxies, well-relaxed systems with very uniformed properties,
## i.e. have very regular colors.
## Uniformity means clear relationship between matter and galaxies.
## LRGs are extremely luminous, so perfect for LSS to probe volume of Universe via spatial clustering.

### SDSS WAVELENGTH CALIBRATION
### The spectroscopic wavelength calibration is done quite accurately in SDSS and BOSS, with typical errors of 2
### km s-1 or better. The wavelength calibration is established using arc calibration frames taken at altitude
### immediately before or after each contiguous sequence of science observations. Low-order adjustments to correct
### for flexure over the course of the observation sequence are made based on the positions of night-sky emission
### lines in each individual exposure.
###
### SDSS USUAL METHOD FOR REDSHIFT AND CLASSIFICATION TEMPLATES
### http://www.sdss.org/dr12/algorithms/redshifts/
### Redshift and classification templates for galaxy, quasar, and CV star classes are constructed by performing a
### rest-frame principal-component analysis (PCA) of training samples of known redshift. The leading
### “eigenspectra” from the PCA results are used to define a linear template basis that is used to model the
### spectra in the redshift analysis.
